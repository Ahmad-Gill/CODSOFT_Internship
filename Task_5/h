🚀 Excited to share my latest project for my CodSoft internship! 🎉

🔍 Task 5: Building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. 🛡️

📝 In this project, I automated the entire process from data loading to model evaluation, ensuring reusability and efficiency. The steps included:

Data loading and preprocessing
Handling class imbalance using oversampling techniques
Training a classification algorithm to classify transactions
Evaluating model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score
Generating insightful plots to visualize results
💡 The code is well-structured and highly automated, making it easily adaptable for future projects with minimal modifications. Excited to share more details soon!
